The cells are individually tested and matched for optimum performancebefore being built into the protective module structure.

A Tedlar ® base is used and ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulate. 

High transmission protects the cells from the front and a high strengthpolymer sheet at the rear. 

A reinforced aluminium frame completes the laminate structure which isfully sealed against moisture and protected from environmental and mechanicaldamage.

Most common mistake people is mixing of battery's. car battery's are notgood in solar storage and have internal resistance
