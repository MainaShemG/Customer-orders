# Customer-orders
Welcome to Customer Orders!This is a project I did for a startup where I was suppossed to create reports from the data on the orders they have been receiving from clients.

The dataset used in this project is titled orders.csv. Additionally, there is a PDF report on the final analysis which also details the business conclusions and recommendationns from this analysis.
I have also pubished various images which are graph visualisations from the dataset.
